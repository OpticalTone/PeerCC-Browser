# PeerCC-JS

WebRTC/ORTC app made in JavaScript adapted to work in Android.

## Getting Started

To install this app on your Android device, send PeerCC.apk file to your device. PeerCC.apk is an already built version of this repo.  
To install from the PeerCC.apk file you will need to allow installation of apps from sources other than the Play Store in *Settings>Lock screen and security>**Unknown sources*** (in newer versions of Android there will be a popup that sends you directly to this when attempting to install)


*For more information about the app check out master branch of this repo [here](https://github.com/OpticalTone/PeerCC-Browser#peercc-browser)*
